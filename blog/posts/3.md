# Peering Restructure

Maryland Mesh underwent a major peering restructure last night, and now its four dedicated servers are sensibly connected. There may still be bugs, and some connections might have dropped. If you were connected to any of the servers, and your Hyperboria connection dropped, then please [let me know](/contact.php).
