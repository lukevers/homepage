# Subreddit theme

Our [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/marylandmesh/) now has a theme! 
Well, kind of. It's just some minimalistic colours that match the 
website's colours!

On another note, email, and a mailing list should be coming shortly. 
We'll write another blog post about it when the time comes shorter!
